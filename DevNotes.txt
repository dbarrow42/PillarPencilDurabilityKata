 - In the Pencil write function, many branching conditionals to handle the lower/uppercase situations. Should look to refactor to simplify (DONE)
 - Made an assumption that a pencil with max durability will not reduce its length upon sharpening
 - Made an assumption that any "symbol" (punctuation, brackets, parens, etc) should be considered uppercase.
    - Could have a HashMap or some form of definition for specific characters and their values but kept simple for this challenge

 - Eraser could probably be its own class. Each Pencil has an Eraser with a certain durability
 - Pencil and Eraser both share the quality of having durability and being able to degrade, could implement a shared Interface
